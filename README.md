# simple-messaging-app-for-android-phones
An application that aims to enable users to message each other with a simple design. To use and try this application produced with KODULAR, it is enough to create and integrate Realtime Database over Google FIREBASE. It can be developed and improved.
# WHILE STARTING
If you have not used CODES before in the application part, I recommend you to watch a few simple videos. You will feel ready in a very short time.

# To-do list.
- First of all, you need to create an account for yourself via **CODES**. My personal advice to you would be to use your Google Account.

- Then you can create a new project from **"creator.kodular.io"** or upload the files I have uploaded.

- At this point, the almost ready-to-use (except Firebase) .apk file in the folder has been added as an example only. Because you can directly download the project you have prepared from KODULAR site as .apk.

- After uploading the Madsenger.aia file to the KODULAR site, we create a membership on **Google FIREBASE** and create the necessary setup and permissions with **Realtime Database and Authentication**.

- One of the important points here is that after creating the Realtime Database, we need to enter the **rules** section and give the necessary permissions. We arrange the "false" parts as "true".

- From here on, it's your imagination.
